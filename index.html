    <H1>The Rules</H1>

<h3>The game starts, and everyone is dealt two cards from the deck. If you or the dealer are dealt a hand with 21, the game ends automatically. It is called a natural. Every card has a value on the card except aces, which are either 1 or 11, jacks, queens, and kings, which are 10. If you want an extra card, you hit, and when you are done, you stand. If you are over 21, then you bust and have lost. After you stand, the dealer decides if they will hit, and then you tally up the points. Whoever has more points wins as long as under 22. In case of a tie, the dealer always wins.</h3></h3>
