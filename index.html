    <H1>The Rules</H1>

    <h3>To start evryone is dealt two cards from the deck. If either you or the dealer is dealt a hand with 21 the game ends automtically. Every card has a value that is the card except aces, which are either 11 or 1, jacks, queens, and kings which are 10. If you want an extra card you hit and when you are done you stand. After you stand the dealer decides if they will hit and then you tally up the points whoever has more points wins as long as under 22. In case of a tie the dealer always wins.</h3>
