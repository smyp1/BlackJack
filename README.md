### The rules of BlackJack.

#### BlackJack is a card game where one tries to get to as close to 21 as possible. You start with two cards being dealt to every player. All cards are worth their face value, while aces are worth 1 or 11 and picture cards are worth 10. If you were dealt a 10 and an ace you automatically win as long as no one else was dealt the same. If you were to have a tie the dealer wins. If you go over 21, then you bust and lose the game. If you want another card, you say hit, and the dealer will deal you another card. When you are comfortable with your hand, you say stand, and then you are done until the next hand.
