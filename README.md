### The rules of black jack.

#### Blackjack is a card game where one tries to get to as close to 21 as possible. You start with two cards being dealt to every player. All cards are worth their face face value, while aces are worth 1 or 11 and picture cards are worth 10. If you were dealt a 10 and an ace you automatically win as long as no one else was dealt the same. If you were to have a tie the house or dealer wins.
